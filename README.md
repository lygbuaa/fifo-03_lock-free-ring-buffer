# What is it?
"Lock-Free Ring Buffer" (LFRB) is a minimal, customizable implementation
of a ring buffer (a.k.a. circular buffer) in C, specifically suitable
for embedded systems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lock-Free Restrictions
The ring buffer does not require any "locking" (mutual exclusion
mechanism) as long as the following restrictions are met:

1. Only one thread/interrupt can produce data into the ring buffer
2. Only one thread/interrupt can consume data from the ring buffer

In other words, a given LFRB can be used only by one pair of producer/
consumer threads/interrupts. Fortunately, this is the most frequently
encountered scenario.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Code Structure
The ring buffer implementation consists of two files located in the
src directory:

- ring_buf.h  - contains the interface
- ring_buf.c  - contains the implementation

The ring buffer holds elements of they type SAL_RINGBUF_CELL_S, which
can be customized (typically uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, float, etc.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test/Example of Use
The directory test contains test/example of using the ring buffer.
Specifically the file test_ring_buf.c tests the whole interface.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Licensing
LFRB is [licensed](LICENSE.txt) under the MIT open source license.
